# GNOBLIN engine

Author: Roger Nogué Ballbé

gitHub: https://github.com/RogerNogue/MVJ_Engine_base

things the engine can NOT do:
-	have multiple lights.
-	modify texts of ImGui.
-	for some reason if a scene is saved with a light and loaded, the light stops working with the loaded scene.
-	since texts from ImGui can not be modified, multiple scenes can be saved but only the first one
	can be loaded (due to its name).
